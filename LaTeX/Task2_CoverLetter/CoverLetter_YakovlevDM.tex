		I am writing to express my interest in the summer camp program within the Euler Foundation. I learned about the foundation through contacting the other students at my university. Therefore, I wish to learn more about the summer camp counselor job opportunity.
		 
		I am currently majoring in Applicable Mathematics and Informatics. Since Euler Foundation promotes mathematical education, I see the mutual benefit in applying for the job. Although I have no experience of supervising at the camps, I have been a camper several times throughout the life.  
		
		I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you privately to discuss the summer camp opportunities on this matter.
		
		Thank you for your time.
